## Project Description
The LED Pattern Generator project demonstrates different LED blinking patterns using Embedded C programming.  
It is a basic embedded systems project useful for understanding GPIO control, delay logic, and digital output operation.

-----

## Components Used
- Microcontroller (8051 / Arduino)
- LEDs
- Resistors (220Ω / 330Ω)
- Breadboard
- Connecting Wires
- Power Supply

-----

## Working Principle
- LEDs are connected to the output pins of the microcontroller.
- The program sends HIGH and LOW signals in a specific sequence.
- Delay functions are used to create visible LED patterns.
- Different patterns such as blinking, running light, and alternate LEDs can be generated.

-----

## LED Pattern implemented
- LEDs turn ON and OFF in a specific sequence to create patterns.
- Left to Right Running Pattern
- Right to Left Running Pattern
- Alternate LED Blinking

-----

## Language Used
- Embedded C
